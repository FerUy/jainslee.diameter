	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.ENABLER; Enabler</title>

	<para>The JAIN SLEE &THIS.ENABLER; Enabler allows JAIN SLEE Applications to interact with a Home Subscriber Server (HSS), hiding the network protocol complexity. The Enabler consists in an SBB which can be used in child relations, with a simple asynchronous interface.</para>

	<para>The HSS is the master user database used in a IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) environment. It contains the subscription-related information to support the network entities actually handling calls/sessions. As an example, the HSS provides support to the call control servers in order to complete the routing/roaming procedures by solving authentication, authorisation, naming/addressing resolution, location dependencies, etc.</para>
